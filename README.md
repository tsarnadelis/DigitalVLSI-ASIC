# DigitalVLSI-ASIC

Files regarding synthesis and floorplanning of a RISC-V processor, using Cadence Genus and Innovus. This project is part of the Digital VLSI-ASIC Design course in the 9th semester at the ECE department of Aristotle University.

## picorv32

This project is based on picorv32 Verilog code, which can be found here: [YosysHQ/picorv32](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32). Using the above RISC-V CPU and Cadence Genus and Innovus, sythesizing, flooraplaning, placing, routing and sign-off are possible. 

## Folder Descriptions

- **Deliverables**: Contains the exercise-specific files including constraints, command scripts, and logs.
- **Instructions-template files**: Contains template files for the project.
- **Timing Constraint Files**: Contains various timing constraint files (.sdc) used in the project.
